### Demo Input Text

A man wearing sunglasses sitting on a park, The man is reading a newspaper, Suddenly the wind blows the newspaper away, The man looks surprised as the newspaper flies through the air, A dog catches the newspaper mid-air, The man looks impressed while the dog does a superhero pose, The dog hands the newspaper back to the man, The man offers a pack of biscuits to the dog as a thank-you gesture, The dog happily accepts the biscuits, Both of them are seen sharing a friendly moment on the park enjoying the day
